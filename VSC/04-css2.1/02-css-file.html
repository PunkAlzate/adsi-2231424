        <h1>CSS External File UwU</h1>
        <p>
            <h3>Keep you in the dark</h3>
You know they all pretend
Keep you in the dark
And so it all began
Send in your skeletons
Sing as their bones go marching in again
They need you buried deep
The secrets that you keep are ever ready
Are you ready?
I'm finished making sense
Done pleading ignorance
That old defense
Spinning infinity, boy
The wheel is spinning me
It's never-ending, never-ending
Same old story
